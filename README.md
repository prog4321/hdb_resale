### USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TO MODEL SINGAPORE HDB FLAT RESALE PRICES
In Singapore, public housing flats are provided by a government body called the Housing Development Board (HDB). These flats have a 99-year lease starting from the year they are released for tenant occupation. After a Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of typically 5 years, the flat owner has the option to sell it on the resale market.

This notebook attempts to create a suitable model (via machine learning and deep learning) that can reasonably approximate the relationship between the various features of a HDB resale flat (resale transaction month, flat type etc.) and the target variable, the resale price.
